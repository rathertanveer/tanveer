        "Answer : In Python, the main difference between a **function** and a **method** is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Function**: A function is a block of reusable code that is independent and can be called anywhere in the code.\n",
        "It is not tied to any specific object and is defined using the `def` keyword. Functions are usually defined at the top level of a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Method**: A method is similar to a function but is associated with an object.\n",
        " It is defined inside a class and is used to perform operations that involve the attributes of the object.\n",
        " Methods are called using the `.` (dot) notation on an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "# Function\n",

        "Answer : In Python, **parameters** and **arguments** are closely related concepts, but they refer to different things in the context of functions:\n",
        "### Parameters\n",
        "- **Parameters** are the names defined in a function's signature. They act as placeholders for the values that the function needs to operate.\n",
        "- You specify parameters when you define the function.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Provide Output from a Function**\n",
        "   - The primary purpose of the `return` statement is to provide an output or result from a function.\n",
        "    When a `return` statement is executed, the function terminates, and the specified value is sent back to where the function was called.\n",
        "   - If no `return` statement is specified, or if it is used without a value, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",

        "In this example, `return a + b` sends the result of the addition (`8`) back to the calling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Terminate a Function Early**\n",
        "   - A `return` statement can be used to **exit a function early**, even if there is more code remaining in the function. This is useful for conditional logic when certain conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "def check_even(number):\n",
        "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",

        "Here, the function exits immediately with \"Even\" if the number is even; otherwise, it returns \"Odd.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Return Multiple Values**\n",
        "   - In Python, a function can use `return` to send back multiple values as a tuple. This is useful when you need to return more than one piece of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**:\n",

        "```\n",
        "In this example, `return name, age` sends back a tuple containing both `name` and `age`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Stopping Execution**\n",
        "   - The `return` statement stops the execution of the function, so any code written after a `return` statement won't be executed.\n",
        "\n",

        "example()\n",
        "# Output: Start\n",
        "```\n",
        "The second `print` statement will not be executed because the function exits as soon as `return` is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "The `return` statement:\n",
        "- **Returns a value** from a function to the caller.\n",

        "- In Python, an object is considered iterable if it implements the `__iter__()` method or if it supports the `__getitem__()` method (which allows you to access items using indices).\n",
        "- Examples of iterables include:\n",
        "  - Lists: `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
        "  - Tuples: `(1, 2, 3)`\n",

This makes generators very memory-efficient, especially when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",

        "### **What is a Generator?**\n",
        "- A generator is a function that returns an **iterator** (called a generator object) that produces a sequence of values one at a time.\n",

        "\n",

        "   - It allows you to handle large datasets without loading everything into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **State Retention**:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Single Use**:\n",
        "   - Generators can only be iterated through **once**. After they are exhausted, they can’t be reused unless recreated.\n",

        "2. **Single Expression**: They can only contain a single expression, which is evaluated and returned. This limits their use to simple functions.\n",
        "3. **Inline Use**: They are typically used in places where a small function is required temporarily and are often passed as arguments to other functions.\n",

        "### **Typical Use Cases for Lambda Functions**\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Using with `filter()`**\n",
        "- `filter()` applies a lambda function to filter elements based on a condition, returning only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n",

        "- Lambda functions are often used for defining simple callbacks in event-driven programming or GUI applications.\n",
